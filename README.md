# ⚙️ Configuration

Settings Dialog Tabs

Tab Content
General Language selection, NAS credentials, SSH key path (with folder open and key creation buttons).
Volumes List of SMB volumes (one per line). The first volume is the main volume and cannot be unchecked.
Timing Auto‑shutdown delay, auto‑start delay, WOL wait, SMB wait, mount retries, and delay between NAS‑ and Mac‑shutdown (0–30 seconds).
Server Profiles Manage all profiles: create, duplicate, rename, delete, and set the active profile.

Configuration Files

All settings are stored in ~/Library/Application Support/SyNasPy/:

- synaspy_config.json – global settings (language, logo, etc.).
- server_profiles.json – all server profiles (including the active profile ID).

Log Files

Logs are written to ~/Library/Application Support/SyNasPy/Logs/ with automatic rotation (max 5 files).

---

# 🐛 Troubleshooting

NAS Not Found

- Use the 🔍 Find IP button in settings.
- Verify the NAS is powered on and connected to the network.

WOL Not Working

- Check the MAC address in settings.
- Ensure the NAS supports WOL and it is enabled.
- Try different WOL methods (the app tries Python‑based, wakeonlan, and etherwake).

Volume Mount Fails

- Confirm the NAS is online and SMB service is running.
- Increase the Mount Retries value in settings.
- Verify volume names are correct (case‑sensitive).

SSH Connection / Shutdown Issues

- If the app asks for a password or fails, run ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa once (or use the 🔑 Create button to create a dedicated key).
- Make sure your SSH key is copied to the NAS (ssh‑copy‑id).
- For sudo shutdown, ensure the user has NOPASSWD for /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/poweroff, and /usr/syno/bin/synopoweroff in /etc/sudoers.
